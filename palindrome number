//A palindrome number is one that remains the same on reversal. Some examples are 8, 121, 212, 12321, -454. To check if a number is a palindrome or not, we reverse it and compare it with the original number, if both are the same, it's a palindrome otherwise not.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int n,r=0,t;
printf("Enter a number to check if it is a palindrome or not\n");
scanf("%d", &n);
t=n;
while (t != 0)
{
r=r*10;
r=r+t%10;
t=t/10;
}
if(n==r)
printf("%d is a palindrome number.\n", n);
else
printf("%d isn't a palindrome number.\n", n);
